        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="blue-border"></div>
        <p>Is it possible to create a story through codes? Can I actually move my characters according the time I set? Make them create a sound? Expressions? If yes, how? - JavaScript is smarter than I thought.
            <br>
            <br> I did not know about this possibility. In this task I am working with JavaScript and CSS with purpose to create a storyline. I believe that this knowledge, I’ve gained through this task, can further help me for creating smarter websites.</p>

                    <p>Create interactive story. The interactive story has to consist of at least 5 chained events that bring the story forward. Sound should be included in the scene. There should be clear visual indication of what is interactive at every step (affordance).</p>

                    <p>I was mainly searching and repeating tutorials on Youtube. Explaining articles on Google about JavaScript were also a big support without which I would not complete this task.</p>

        <div class="bd-text">
            <div>
                <p>The story is the adjusted scene from the task <strong>Story telling and character design</strong>, where I created the story about friendship love between the girl Muanka and her pet Mukukaka. </p>
                <div class="bd-subtitel">Scene 1.</div>
                <p> The scene starts with the two friends standing next to each other <i>(they are spending their time together)</i>, slow piano music in the background <i>(for the calm atmosphere)</i> and fade in and out animation of the heart <i>(which shows love between them)</i>. </p>
                <div class="bd-subtitel">Scene 2.</div>
                <p> For the scene two Muanka suddenly hears weird sound in the house. She is going out of the room to look what is it. Meanwhile her pet Mukukaka is noticing her lunch. Mukukaka can’t defeat his animal insticts and he is going to eat Muanka’s lunch. <i>I created this scene as a plot of the story.</i> </p>
                <div class="bd-subtitel">Scene 3.</div>
                <p> Muanka sees how Mukukaka ate her lunch. She is angry and she is screaming on Mukukaka. Mukukaka is just the animal. He can’t understand properly why is Muanka angry. He just feels that Muanka is not loving him anymore. He is sad. <i>This conflict is made as a climax of the story.</i> </p>
                <div class="bd-subtitel">Scene 4.</div>
                <p> What will Muanka do right now? Will she forgive Mukukaka or going away and be angry? User who is watching the story has the option to decide with two buttons how the story is going to end. If the user is choosing the button Love, the characters are going to close to each other again. If the button Angry is chosen, then the two characters are going away in the different directions. <i>The end of the story is made with the purpose of making the user feels that she/he is the part of the story for the better connection with the story.</i></p>
