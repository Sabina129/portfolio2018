                <p>We had 3 days for this assignment. The obstacle was that this group was formed later, because some of the group members were not present.<br>
To be honest we had many great ideas, but they would required more time to be efficient. We needed to be creative within a one day.
Our creative thinking led us to our personal experiences of busy life, which we can feel every day. 
<br><br>
Messenger notifications are distracting us daily through out the day with many messages about a duties, advertisments, friends calls and list goes on. We perceive it as a normal thing, because we live in this age of technology since we can remember. But is it really normal? Can we always handle it without stress? We as a group believe, that we can show how can our hidden busy life without spoken words looks like.<br><br>Our steps were simple. We decided about the idea of making video through “mobile” perspective, where the main character Paul is writing on messanger. 
<br><br>
Then we created roles for ourselves.  The roles were - Paul’s girlfriend, boss at work and classmate from school.<br>
We decided that we will create the script, where all of us will rush Paul to do something with impossible time limits. He will try to handle it. 
<br><br>
After we created the script we were recording the screen. We started to write messeges according to the roles we had.<br>
The video was succesfully made after 3 attemps.
The last process was to add some more footages of Paul as an opening scene and ending scene for the audience to see him as a main character with his phone.<br>
Then we could edit the video and add the emotional music.
We chose the  suspense music intentionaly in order to add our story more tension.</p>
